2021/2022 PAML pilot project

## About

Friendzymes is producing the first practical demonstration of a new lab automation standard, Protocol Activity Markup/Modeling Language (PAML), applied to a real, multi-lab task. We are aiming to use all of the Friendzymes network's OT-2s as part of this work. The wetlab task itself has been chosen for simplicity, since the initial focus is simply on using PAML to do it. It is a basic Golden Gate protocol. Friendzymes is collaborating with CRI Paris and London Biofoundry on this pilot. The publication target for initial outcomes is the COMBINE organization's spring event, HARMONY 2022. This event is typically held mid-March. Other PAML working groups are targeting this date as well.
